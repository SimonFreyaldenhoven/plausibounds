Description: Implements the additions to dynamic effect plots suggested in Freyaldenhoven and Hansen (2026). Data-driven smoothing delivers a smooth estimated path with potentially improved point estimation properties and confidence regions covering a surrogate that can be substantially tighter than conventional pointwise or uniform bands.
