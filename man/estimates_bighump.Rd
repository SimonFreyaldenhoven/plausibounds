\title{Sinusoidal Estimates with Moderate Correlation}
\format{
A numeric vector with 36 elements
}
\source{
Generated from simulation with sinusoidal design and moderate correlation (rho = 0.5)
}
\usage{
estimates_bighump
}
\description{
A dataset containing estimates with a curved sinusoidal pattern in the first
6 periods that then converges to zero for the remaining 30 periods. The effect
is a smooth curved trajectory with a large dip before the treatment effect quickly returns to 0.
Generated with moderate correlation (rho = 0.5).
