\title{Pretrends Estimates with Significant Pre-Treatment Trends}
\format{
A numeric vector with 18 elements (6 pre-treatment, 12 post-treatment)
}
\source{
Generated from simulation with linear pretrend design and moderate correlation (rho = 0.4)
}
\usage{
estimates_pretrends
}
\description{
A dataset containing estimates with significant pretrends in the first 6
pre-treatment periods followed by 12 post-treatment periods. This dataset
exhibits a linear trend before treatment that violates the parallel trends
assumption, making it useful for testing pretrend detection methods.
Statistical tests would reject the null hypothesis of no pretrends.
