\title{Wiggly Estimates with Moderate Correlation in Errors}
\format{
A numeric vector with 12 elements
}
\source{
Generated from simulation with wiggly design and moderate correlation (rho = 0.8)
}
\usage{
estimates_wiggly_corr
}
\description{
A dataset containing estimates from a wiggly (oscillating) design with moderate
correlation in errors. The true effect follows an oscillating path with noise that
eventually becomes flat, representing a treatment effect with complex dynamics before
stabilization. The errors have moderate correlation structure (rho = 0.8), with
correlation decreasing as the time between periods increases.
